Veggie Burger App 
Author: Morgan Hamlin
Technologies: This app uses mysql, node.js, express.js, body-parser, handlebars.js, bootstrap, and fontAwesome.

What it Does: Using this application, you can add new burgers to the restaurant, and they will appear in the left section of the html page, along with a "devour" button. When the devour button is clicked, the burger moves to the right side or the "devoured" side of the webpage. The user cannot move the burger back over the the left side.

How it Works: This application uses the ORM programming technique to allow for conversion of data across different systems. A database was created through mySQL workbench. A router was created using express.js. This allows the user to  read(burgers that exist), add(new burgers), and update(if the burger has been devoured) data from the browser. The configuration involves a server that contains an if/else statement allowing the app to run through Heroku or locahost: 8080. The db folder contains the server scripts that set up the database. The burger.js file is a model that uses the ORM to update the database. The public folder holds all css and image information. The main and index handlebars present the data while allowing for styling.
